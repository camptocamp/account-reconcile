9.3.0 (2016-07-25)
++++++++++++++++++

**Data Migration**

* Modules are now set as 'uninstalled' before we run anthem to prevent a lot
  of warnings at the start of anthem (which imports 'openerp')

  might still be longer but are not allowed to be used.

  a new menu

  variants, the creation of hundreds of variants is near 2 times faster

9.1.0 (2016-06-29)
++++++++++++++++++

First tagged version of the migration.
The code and data migration are far to be ready, but things become testable
now.

**Data Migration**

* Migrate Claims Sequences
* Migrate Sales Shop data to QoQa Shop
* Migrate product attributes and brand
* And a handful of other fixes to the data

**Features and Improvements**

* First working version of `connector_qoqa` for QoQa4. Still a few API calls
  missing and edges a bit rough but good enough for the first tests.
* Most of the CRM and Claims addons are migrated
* A lot of addons migrated

**Bugfixes**

* Slow accounting dashboard: had to override
  account.account_journal_dashboard methods to change a few
  ORM calls by direct SQL and to totally remove one slow computation (account
  balance) and the graphs
* Speed up loading of the product view, when counting number of sales and
  purchases, the fix is naive though and needs improvements (doesn't consider
  company_id and user_id rules)

**Build**

* Use camptocamp/postgresql:pg9.5-latest in the dev composition
* Travis builds the test server on Rancher with the latest image on each commit
* Added Rancher composition for the integration server

**Documentation**

* Added Docker and Rancher documentation
