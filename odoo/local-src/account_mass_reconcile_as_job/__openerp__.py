Account Mass Reconcile as Jobs
==============================

Modify the mass reconcile to do only the search (create the groups to
reconcile), but process them asynchronously as jobs.

It could be a generic one but, especially in 9.0, it's a bit hackish and there
are some drawbacks:

 * we need to put some code in every inherited reconcile method, due to a bug
   before Odoo 10.0 (inherit models don't get changes done on a base model
   after an inherit)
 * the behavior is a bit weird as the design of the addon was really thought
   for a synchronous workflow (the history shows the last reconciled lines,
   which will no longer work)

The feature can be disabled by setting the ir.config_parameter
"account.mass.reconcile.as.job" to False.
